                <strong>Chapter 2: The Transformation</strong> <br />
                During my gap year before starting my undergrad at National
                University of Singapore (NUS), I joined Mastermind School as a
                9th grade bio teacher, and it changed my life forever. I finally
                found my secret talent- teaching bio. I wanted everyone to
                understand that biology isn’t about memorizing at all, it’s
                about simply understanding and putting puzzle pieces together
                that make sense. It took a few months but the class completely
                transformed. They all starting loving bio. Even the C grade
                students started getting As and I couldn’t believe I would have
                to stop the progress because the end was near.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                <strong>Chapter 4: The Holidays</strong> <br />Even though
                university started, I didn’t wanna stop. Every holiday, I’d
                return and continue teaching in my big living room which then
                become too small as the population of students started to
                increase exponentially. I had to take multiple batches, which
                meant more time teaching, sometimes from 8 am to 8 pm straight.
                And I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT! They were the best holidays of
                my life.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                <strong>Chapter 6: The Retirement</strong> <br />
                Uni got harder and it became crucial to study for MCAT and
                GAMSAT during my holidays. Summer research offers poured in and
                I was sucked into the research world. Bioland came to an end,
                but I was really glad of the good work we did with class of 2017
                and 2018. I still reread the beautiful words the students wrote
                about my work, and weep like a Potterhead reading the last
                sentence of deathly hallows. All was well.

                <strong>Chapter 1: The Epiphany</strong> <br />
                I always used to wonder how come all my classmates thought
                biology was all about ‘memorization’ and ‘it was hard’ and
                ‘pointless’, and apparently so did all the parents. I wondered
                why there aren’t university programs like Neuroscience or life
                sciences in Bangladesh. And then I realized why: High school bio
                teachers really ‘suck’.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                <strong>Chapter 3: The Genesis</strong> <br />
                So, I decided not to stop. They wanted me to finish the
                syllabus; so many things were left to explore. And they
                suggested I should start teaching outside school. Not on the
                streets, but at my home. I turned the living room into a giant
                classroom. And formed my own little world, where I could safely
                teach all day, every day. I will teach O level bio, human bio
                and special extra classes for Biology Olympiad.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                <strong>Chapter 5: The Triumph</strong> <br />
                Results rolled in, and thankfully most of them achieved A*s and
                a few As. Everyone did remarkably. It was record breaking
                success in biology results in the history of Mastermind. But
                what I was most jubilant about was the fact that most of them
                decided to take biology in A levels and even major in
                biosciences at uni. They ACTUALLY stopped seeing bio as this
                boring, undefeatable monster, and started seeing the
                breathtakingly ethereal beauty as it was.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                <strong>Chapter 7: The Return</strong> <br />
                Teaching is what I love. So even though I was in my final
                semester of uni, I opened neuro and physiology tutoring group
                classes at University of Melbourne, similar to what I did in
                Bangladesh. And I realized how much I missed it. I missed
                standing in front of a packed classroom and passionately
                elucidating the elegance of the biological world. That feeling
                of transcendence cannot be explained by words. And I was hooked,
                like a junkie relapsing into old addictions. So here I am back
                in Bangladesh, restarting Bioland. Applications are open. So,
                apply soon if you wanna be a part of the biological Hogwarts.
